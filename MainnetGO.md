# NEAR Validator GuideüöÄ

# Definitions

* <pool_id> or pool_id - your pool name, for example nearuaguild
* <full_pool_id> or full_pool_id - xxx.poolv1.near, where xxx is your pool_id
* <accountId\> or accountId  - xxx.near where xxx your account name, for example nearukraineguild.near

# Setup using NEARCore

#### Step 1 ‚Äì Installation required software & set the configuration

* Before you start, you might want to ensure your system is up to date.
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
* Install Python
```
sudo apt install python3 git curl
```
* Install Building env
```
sudo apt install clang build-essential make
```
* Install Rust & Cargo
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
Press 1 and press enter
![img](/images/rust.png)

* Source the environment
```
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```
* Clone the NEARCore Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore.git
```
* Set environment to the latest release tag. For the latest release tag, please check here: https://github.com/near/nearcore/releases.  Note: RC tags are for Testnet only.
```
export NEAR_RELEASE_VERSION=1.36.5
```
```
cd nearcore
git checkout $NEAR_RELEASE_VERSION
make release
```
* Install Nodejs and NPM
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs
PATH="$PATH"
```
* Install Near CLI

Once NodeJs and NPM are installed you can now install NEAR-Cli.

Unless you are logged in as root, which is not recommended you will need to use `sudo` to install NEAR-Cli so that the near binary to /usr/local/bin
```
sudo npm install -g near-cli
```
* Launch this command so set the Near Mainnet Environment:
```
export NEAR_ENV=mainnet
```
* You can also run this command to set the Near testnet Environment persistent:
```
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=mainnet' >> ~/.bashrc
```
#### Step 2 ‚Äì Create a wallet
MainNet: https://wallet.near.org/

#### Step 3 ‚Äì Authorize Wallet Locally
A full access key needs to be installed locally to be able transactions via NEAR-Cli.

* You need to run this command:
```
near login
```
> Note: This command launches a web browser allowing for the authorization of a full access key to be copied locally.

1 ‚Äì Copy the link in your browser

![img](/images/1.png)

2 ‚Äì Grant Access to Near CLI

![img](/images/3.png)

3 ‚Äì After Grant, you will see a page like this, go back to console

![img](/images/4.png)

4 ‚Äì Enter your wallet and press Enter

![img](/images/5.png)

#### Step 4 ‚Äì Initialize & Start the Node
* From nearcore folder initialize NEAR:
```
target/release/neard init --chain-id="mainnet" --account-id=<full_pool_id>
```
**Note that if you want to download blocks faster just stop command after initialization and go further by guide.

* Download the latest genesis and config, if config already exist just delete it and download a new one:
```
cd ~/.near
rm genesis.json (if exists)
rm config.json (if exists)
wget -c https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/mainnet/genesis.json
wget -c https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/build.nearprotocol.com/nearcore-deploy/mainnet/config.json
```
* Download the latest snapshot from [the snapshot page](https://near-nodes.io/intro/node-data-snapshots).
##### Create `validator_key.json`
* Generate the Key file:
```
near generate-key <full_pool_id>
```
* Copy the file generated to Mainnet folder.Make sure to replace YOUR_WALLET by your accountId
```
cp ~/.near-credentials/mainnet/<full_pool_id>.json ~/.near/validator_key.json
vi ~/.near/validator_key.json
```
* Edit ‚Äúaccount_id‚Äù => full_pool_id
* Change ‚Äúprivate_key‚Äù to ‚Äúsecret_key‚Äù
> Note: The account_id must match the staking pool contract name or you will not be able to sign blocks.
> File content must be something like :
> {
>   "account_id": "xxx.poolv1.near",
>   "public_key": "ed25519:HeaBJ3xLgvZacQWmEctTeUqyfSU4SDEnEwckWxd92W2G",
>   "secret_key": "ed25519:****"
> }

> Note: The account_id must match the staking pool contract name or you will not be able to sign blocks.

* Start the Node
```
target/release/neard run
```
* Setup Systemd
Command:

```
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/neard.service
```
Paste:

```[Unit]

### Becoming a Validator
In order to become a validator and enter the validator set, a minimum set of success criteria must be met.

* The node must be fully synced
* The `validator_key.json` must be in place
* The contract must be initialized with the public_key in `validator_key.json`
* The account_id must be set to the staking pool contract id
* There must be enough delegations to meet the minimum seat price. See the seat price [here](https://explorer.mainnet.near.org/nodes/validators).
* A proposal must be submitted by pinging the contract
* Once a proposal is accepted a validator must wait 2-3 epoch to enter the validator set
* Once in the validator set the validator must produce great than 90% of assigned blocks

Check running status of validator node. If ‚ÄúValidator‚Äù is showing up, your pool is selected in the current validators list.

### Submitting Pool Information
Adding pool information helps delegators and also helps with outreach for upgrades and other important announcements: https://github.com/zavodil/near-pool-details.
The available fields to add are: https://github.com/zavodil/near-pool-details/blob/master/FIELDS.md.

The identifying information that we ask the validators:to provide are:
- Name
- Description
- URL
- Country and country code
- Email (for support)
- Telegram, Discord, or Twitter

Command:

```
near call name.near update_field '{"pool_id": "<full_pool_id>", "name": "url", "value": "https://yoururl.com"}' --accountId=<accountId>  --gas=200000000000000
```
```
near call name.near update_field '{"pool_id": "<full_pool_id>", "name": "twitter", "value": "<twitter>"}' --accountId=<accountId>  --gas=200000000000000
```
```
near view name.near get_all_fields '{"from_index": 0, "limit": 3}'
```
```
near view name.near get_fields_by_pool '{"pool_id": "<full_pool_id>"}'
```

## STAKING POOLS
NEAR uses a staking pool factory with a whitelisted staking contract to ensure delegators‚Äô funds are safe. In order to run a validator on NEAR, a staking pool must be deployed to a NEAR account and integrated into a NEAR validator node. Delegators must use a UI or the command line to stake to the pool. A staking pool is a smart contract that is deployed to a NEAR account.

### Deploy a Staking Pool Contract
#### Deploy a Staking Pool
Calls the staking pool factory, creates a new staking pool with the specified name, and deploys it to the indicated accountId.

For Mainnet
```
near call poolv1.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "<pool_id>", "owner_id": "<accountId>", "stake_public_key": "<public key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId="<accountId>" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```

From the example above, you need to replace:

* **Pool ID**: Staking pool name, the factory automatically adds its name to this parameter, creating {pool_id}.{staking_pool_factory}
Examples:   

- `XXX` for mainnet, for example "nearuaguild"

* **Owner ID**: The NEAR account that will manage the staking pool. Usually your main NEAR account.
* **Public Key**: The public key in your **validator_key.json** file.
* **5**: The fee the pool will charge (e.g. in this case 5 over 100 is 5% of fees).
* **Account Id**: The NEAR account deploying the staking pool.

> Be sure to have at least 30 NEAR available, it is the minimum required for storage.

To change the pool parameters, such as changing the amount of commission charged to 1% in the example below, use this command:
```
near call <full_pool_id> update_reward_fee_fraction '{"reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 1, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId <account_id> --gas=300000000000000
```


You will see something like this:

![img](/images/create_pool_result.png)

If there is a ‚ÄúTrue‚Äù at the End. Your pool is created.

**You have now configure your Staking pool.**

#### Manage your staking pool contract
> HINT: Copy/Paste everything after this line into a text editor and use search and replace. Once your pool is deployed, you can issue the commands below:


##### Retrieve the owner ID of the staking pool

Command:

```
near view {full_pool_id} get_owner_id '{}'
```
##### Issue this command to retrieve the public key the network has for your validator
Command:

```
near view {full_pool_id} get_staking_key '{}'
```
##### If the public key does not match you can update the staking key like this (replace the pubkey below with the key in your validator.json file)

```
near call {full_pool_id} update_staking_key '{"stake_public_key": "<public key>"}' --accountId <accountId>
```

### Working with Staking Pools
> NOTE: Your validator must be fully synced before issuing a proposal or depositing funds.

### Proposals

In order to get a validator seat you must first submit a proposal with an appropriate amount of stake. Proposals are sent for epoch +2. Meaning if you send a proposal now, if approved, you would get the seat in 3 epochs. You should submit a proposal every epoch to ensure your seat. To send a proposal we use the ping command. A proposal is also sent if a stake or unstake command is sent to the staking pool contract.

To note, a ping also updates the staking balances for your delegators. A ping should be issued each epoch to keep reported rewards current on the pool contract. You could set up a ping using a cron job or use [Cron Cat](https://cron.cat/).

## Steps

Create a new file on /home/<USER_ID>/scripts/ping.sh

```
#!/bin/sh
# Ping call to renew Proposal added to crontab

export NEAR_ENV=mainnet
export LOGS=/home/<USER_ID>/logs
export POOLID=<full_pool_id>
export ACCOUNTID=<account_id>

echo "---" >> $LOGS/all.log
date >> $LOGS/all.log

near call $POOLID ping '{}' --accountId $ACCOUNTID --gas=300000000000000 >> $LOGS/all.log

near proposals | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log
near validators current | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log
near validators next | grep $POOLID >> $LOGS/all.log

```

Create logs folder:

```
mkdir $HOME/logs
```

Change execute permission for ping.sh file:

```
chmod +x $HOME/scripts/ping.sh
```

Create a new crontab, running every 2 hours:

```
crontab -e
0 */2 * * * sh /home/<USER_ID>/scripts/ping.sh
```

List crontab to see it is running:
```
crontab -l
```

Review your logs

```
cat $HOME/logs/all.log
```

That is it, now you need to have enough delegated tokens to be an active validator, welcome to decentralized Near Protocol!
